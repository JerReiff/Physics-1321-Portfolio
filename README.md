# Physics-1321-Portfolio
Collection of exercises and investigations completed during my time in Computational Methods in Physics at the University of Pittsburgh.
This portfolio was created at the end of 2018, and therefore was completed and "dead" by the time it was published here.
Additional helpers and authors of course material are credited in the python notebook "Final Portfolio.ipynb"
