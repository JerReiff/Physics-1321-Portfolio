# Physics-1321-Portfolio
Collection of exercises and investigations completed during my time in Computational Methods in Physics at the University of Pittsburgh.
This portfolio was created at the end of 2018, and therefore was completed and "dead" by the time it was published here. Many of the animations don't work correctly in browser and mess with formatting, so if you'd like to see every cell run correctly, download and run in an environment such as JuPyter Notebook (make sure you have ffmpeg!).
Additional helpers and authors of course material are credited in the python notebook "Final Portfolio.ipynb"
